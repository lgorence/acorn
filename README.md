# Acorn
Acorn is a experimental shell for my Wayland compositor, [Oak](https://github.com/lgorence/oak).
It uses Skia as a graphics engine. Acorn is primarily targeted at mobile devices, such as the Pinephone.

## Developing
Due to the complexity of building Skia, Acorn isn't just a "clone and build" kind of thing.
You're on your own for figuring this out, at least until I get around to cleaning it up.
